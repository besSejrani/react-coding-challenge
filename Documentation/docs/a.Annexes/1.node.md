# Node.js

## Javascript Runtime

Node.js is a Javascript runtime environment and not a programming language. It'uses Chrome's open source Javascript engine, V8. By incorporating V8, it has access to the OS APIs. Since Javascript is single threated, is uses an Event Loop, an Event Queue and a thread Pool for executing asychronous tasks.

Node.js is highly performant for I/O tasks, but struggles with CPU instensive tasks, like file uploads.

## Express Middlewares

Express is a light server built on top of Node.js, it comes with a lot of functionnalities and can be set really quickly.One important feature of Express, is that it is middleware based.

Think of a middleware like a function that executes before a controller in a MVC architecture. Doing so, it is possible for example, to authenticate and authorize users and add business Logic in middlewares.

In Express, any function which accepts requests and send a next() function back, is considered as a valid middleware.
