# Project

<hr/>

## Boilerplate code

Having worked with React and Node.js for 3 years now (non-professionally), I had a lot of code snippets and projects already done. I didn't want to reinvent the wheel, so I used my existing code from other projects, especially `BlueberryShop` and `ChillMovie`.

## Time constraints

I tried to stick as much as possible to the time constraints, therefore, I couldn't finish the statistics page with interactive charts. The planning details page is finished, but it isn't polished.
