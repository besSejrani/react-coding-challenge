# Make

<hr />

## Use Case

Make allows to automate a program's build process. By installing the project via containers, make is mostly used to inject a environment variable to Docker-Compose which will then be injected in the application.

=== "Makefile"

    ```make
    # Production
    run-prod:
        ENVIRONMENT=production \
        docker-compose up

    # Development
    run-dev:
        ENVIRONMENT=development \
        docker-compose up

    run-dev-build:
        ENVIRONMENT=development \
        docker-compose up --build --remove-orphans
    ```

    Make for Windows can be installed via the following [link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/make/3.81/make-3.81.exe/download?use_mirror=jztkft&download=).

    Don't forget to add Make's path to your environment variables if the installer doesn't do it automatically.

    ```sh
    brew install make
    ```

    ```sh
    # Update & upgrade packages
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
