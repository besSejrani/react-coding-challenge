## Github Actions

Hosting documentation on Github Pages, via Mkdocs, can be done with the help of Github Actions, an automation software.

In the following YAML file, each time that code is pushed to the master / main repository branch, it launches a job in an Ubuntu environment and deploys the content to Github Pages.

=== "Github Actions"

```yaml
name: ci
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: Documentation
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.x

      - run: pip install mkdocs-material
