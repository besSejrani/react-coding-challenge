# UI Library

## Material UI

For Aspaara Planning, Material UI was chosen since it provides already built-in components. Other solutions, like [styled components](https://styled-components.com/), could have been used, but due to the time constraint, this solution wasn't viable.

Any other UI library could have been used instead of Material UI, like [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started) or [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). Having experience with Material UI, I went this route, trying to spend the least amount of time possible.
