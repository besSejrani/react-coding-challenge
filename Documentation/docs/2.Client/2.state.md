# State Management

## Redux

Redux was chosen as the state management solution over the Context API since I have experience with it, and implementing it was quite fast.

Although I implemented it because of my experience and the time constraints, Redux is supported by a large community with third party libraries and a lot of Stackoverflow questions already answered.

## Other State Management Solution

Other state management solutions could have been used, like Apollo client for GraphQL, but since it handles GraphQL queries, this implies that there are some changes to be made on the server. For this project, I wanted a small and fast solution.
